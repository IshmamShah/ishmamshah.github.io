## About

Hi! I am Ishmam. I am a second-year PhD student at NCSU Chemistry, previously Purdue Chemistry advised by [Sabre Kais](https://ece.ncsu.edu/people/skais/). 
My current research interest includes quantum simulation of chemical and biological systems. I aim to understand nature at its most fundamental, faster, and better.
